This module is a copy of the FAPE module but to use specifically to edit Bean in a context.

It is highly recommended you install both the Panels and Contextual
modules alongside FABE.

To make use of this module, first enable the module. Then enable
Contextual and Panels. For any panel that has an entity context,
users who have access to edit the fields on that entity and have
contextual links access will see a contextual link allowing
them to edit that bean.
